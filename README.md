# OpenGL-projects


# Title

My projects in master degree semester 2， including my learning and debugging processes. 


## Installation
- All the `code` required to get started

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/LiuSirui99/OpenGL-projects.git`

### Setup

```
I am using MacOS Catalina version 10.15.6 and windows 10.

For setting up in windows: 

1. You will need to install a copy of Visual Studio Community Edition (freely downloadable for anyone) https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
2. [Recommended] GLSL plugin is installable under Extensions->Manage extensions in VS 2019 (for older VS versions, see samizzo/nshader)
3. You will need to download our OGLPack (http://cg.elte.hu/~bsc_cg/resources/OGLPack.zip).

The project we will use in practises will search these libraries at T:\OGLPack. The simplest option for Windows is to run a command 'subst t: c:\' and save the OGLPack to root of C:\. That will cause a drive T: to appear in Windows Explorer, you have to have a T:\OGLPack\include path (in which there are several files), for projects to work.

You will need your computer to support OpenGL version 4.0 at least. You can check the what your system supports by running OGLPack\bin\x64\glewinfo.exe and find the result in glewinfo.txt. If your video card should support OpenGL 4.0 but that does not appear in glewinfo.txt, update or install its driver.


In case of opengl in mac, git clone one of my xcode projects and then modify the path 
of include hearder and library as it installed in your machine.
```

### Testing

For testing your settings, clone the <a href="https://github.com/LiuSirui99/Opencv-projects/compare/" target="_blank">`http://cg.elte.hu/~agostons/cg_en/week1/`</a> and press run. 
You should see an new displaying window as a result.
